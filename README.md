rSyncRunner
===========

I had a batch file for running cwRsync but I didn't understand much of how it work.
I had also made a python script to clean up the rSync log, leaving only deleted items.
I decided recreate both in C# as a fun project.

It might not be perfect, but it does everything I need it to successfully.
